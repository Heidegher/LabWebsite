    descrizione:
      "I did my undergraduate and graduate studies at the University of Rome Tor Vergata (Italy). I carried out my PhD studies in the lab of Professor Maria Teresa Carrì in Rome, where I started to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. In particular, at that time, I was interested in how ALS-associated mutations in the FUS/TLS gene cause problems to the splicing machinery. For my post-doctoral studies, I joined the lab of Tom Maniatis at Columbia University, where I pursued the role of TBK1, a protein involved in autophagy and immunity, in ALS. After 8 years at Columbia University, I moved back to Rome to establish my own independent research lab at the Fondazione Santa Lucia. In my free time I enjoy aerial dance: you can easily find me hanging on aerial silks or aerial hoops in the studio when I am not in the lab.",

      "My name is Olga Carletta and I am 29 years old. I graduated in Neurobiology at the University of Pavia (Italy). I joined the Gerbino Lab at the beginning of 2023 and since 2024 I am also enrolled in the PhD course in Biomedical Sciences and Technologies at the University of Rome “Roma Tre”. I've always been interested in science from when I was a kid and saw Rita Levi Montalcini on TV. During university I developed a special interest in the study of neurodegeneration diseases. In my free time I like to draw and go to cultural events.",

    descrizione:
      "My name is Camilla Perfetto and I graduated in Genetics and Molecular Biology at the University of Rome La Sapienza (Italy) in 2024. I have always had a deep interest in science, a passion that has guided me throughout my academic journey. During my master's thesis, I had the opportunity to approach the field of neuroscience, an area that fascinated me to the point of pursuing it further as my professional direction. In addition to science, I have many other passions that enrich my daily life. I love sports and I enthusiastically follow various TV series, which I consider an enjoyable way to unwind and be entertained.",

    descrizione:
      "My name is Francesca Manganelli, and I graduated in Molecular Biology and Genetics at the University of Pavia (Italy). Since I was a child, I had a strong tendency to curiosity and a desire for understanding life itself, which drove me to pursue a career path in science. The study of the brain has always interested me. Soon after my Master’s Thesis, I moved to Paris (France) to join the ICM (Institute for brain and spinal cord studies), where I was introduced to the world of neurodegenerative diseases. I soon decided that I wanted to continue my studies into the functioning of the brain at the cellular level. Thus, I moved to Rome to join the Gerbino Lab and work on ALS. Since 2025 I am also a PhD student in the PhD Program in Cellular and Molecular Biology at the University of Rome Tor Vergata.",
